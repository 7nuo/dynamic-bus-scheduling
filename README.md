# Description

This is the repository of the project **_"Bus Scheduling including Dynamic Events"_**.

The project is an extension of [Mobile Network Assisted Driving (MoNAD)] (https://github.com/EricssonResearch/monad), an application for generating dynamic bus schedules, which was developed by a student group at [Uppsala University] (http://www.uu.se/en/) in the scope of the [Project Computer Science 2015] (http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/projektDV/ht15) course.

The implementation is in collaboration with [Ericsson Research] (http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/company_facts/research) which is member of [CityPulse] (http://www.ict-citypulse.eu/page/content/publications), a European project that focuses on the development of a distributed framework for semantic discovery and processing of large-scale real-time Internet of Things and relevant social data streams, which could be used for knowledge extraction in city environments.

The main objective is to investigate how and whether a real-time processing component for efficient and scalable adaptive reasoning, such as the CityPulse Desicion Support component, could be used for identifying and handling of data sources and events that affect the daily schedule.
