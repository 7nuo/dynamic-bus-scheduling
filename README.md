# Bus Scheduling including Dynamic Events

This application introduces a reasoning mechanism capable of evaluating travel requests and generating bus timetables with reduced average waiting time for passengers. Furthermore, the system has the potential to detect traffic flow and make adjustments to the regular path of each bus, so as to decrease the waiting time which is a result of traffic congestion.

# Contributors

The application is supervised by [Ericsson] (https://www.ericsson.com/) and is related to [CityPulse] (http://www.ict-citypulse.eu/), a European project that focuses on the development of a distributed framework for semantic discovery and processing of large-scale real-time Internet of Things and relevant social data streams, which could be used for knowledge extraction in city environments.
